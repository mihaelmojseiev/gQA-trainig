# 1 You have a list of elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
# Loop through the list using the foreach loop.
# The element with an odd index is put into a new list of tuples where the first element is the index and the second is the value.
# [(index, value)]. accordingly, elements with an even index are placed in another list of tuples with the same format as in the case with odd indices.
